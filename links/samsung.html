    <P>Samsung Group,[3] or simply Samsung (Korean: 삼성 [samsʌŋ]), is a South Korean multinational,<BR>
        manufacturing conglomerate headquartered in Samsung Town, Seoul, South Korea.[1] It comprises<BR>
         numerous affiliated businesses,[1] most of them united under the Samsung brand, and is the <BR>
         largest South Korean chaebol (business conglomerate). As of 2020, Samsung has the eighth <BR>
         highest global brand value.[4]<BR><BR>

        Samsung was founded by Lee Byung-chul in 1938 as a trading company. Over the next three<BR>
         decades, the group diversified into areas including food processing, textiles, insurance<BR>
         , securities, and retail. Samsung entered the electronics industry in the late 1960s and <BR>
         the construction and shipbuilding industries in the mid-1970s; these areas would drive its<BR> 
         subsequent growth. Following Lee's death in 1987, Samsung was separated into five business<BR>
          groups – Samsung Group, Shinsegae Group, CJ Group and Hansol Group, and JoongAng Group.</P>
