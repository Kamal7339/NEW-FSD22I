       <p> Redmi is a subsidiary company owned by the Chinese electronics company Xiaomi.<br><br>
         It was first announced in July 2013 as a budget smartphone line,[1] <br>
         and became a separate sub-brand of Xiaomi in 2019 with entry-level and<br>
          mid-range devices, while Xiaomi itself produces upper-range and flagship Xiaomi <br>
          <I>(formerly Mi)</I> phones.<br><br> Redmi phones use the <B>Xiaomi's MIUI</B> user <br>interface on top
           of Android. <br><br>Models are divided into the entry-level Redmi, the mid-range Redmi Note,<br>
            and the high-end Redmi K. In addition, the unrelated Mi A Android One series is also<br>
             positioned in the similar market segment with Redmi devices, despite being part of<br>
              the upper-range Xiaomi Mi lineup. The most significant difference from other Xiaomi <br>
              smartphones is that they use less-expensive components and thus have lower prices <br>
              while retaining higher specifications. In August 2014, The Wall Street Journal<br>
               reported that in the second quarter of the 2014 fiscal year, Xiaomi had a market<br>
                share of 4% of smartphone shipment rankings in China.[2] Redmi sales were attributed <br>
                as a contributing factor toward this gain in shipment rankings.[2]</p></HR>
